# Sound Categories `v2`

Fabric library that allows mods to add more sound categories, and modifies the Minecraft sound settings menu to fit as
many categories as required.

## Adding to your project

The build artifact is hosted on [my personal Maven server](https://artifactory.kow08absty.com/ui/repos/tree/General/fabricmc/dev/stashy/sound-categories). Add the following to your
repositories block:

```groovy
maven {
    name = "lonefelidae16's repo"
    url = "https://artifactory.kow08absty.com/artifactory/fabricmc"
}
```

And the following to your dependencies:

```groovy
modImplementation include("dev.stashy:sound-categories:${project.soundcategories_version}")
```

Then add the mod version to your gradle.properties. Make sure to `include()` to embed the library into your mod, as otherwise the user will have to download
it separately.

## Adding a category

Classes that contain sound categories must implement `CategoryLoader` so that they are picked up by the loader. Every
SoundCategory you define must have the `Register` annotation - they will have the category reference injected once it is
created.

Example class:

```java
import dev.stashy.soundcategories.CategoryLoader;
import net.minecraft.sound.SoundCategory;

public class CustomCategories implements CategoryLoader
{
    @Register(master = true)
    public static SoundCategory MOD_MAIN;
    @Register
    public static SoundCategory SUBCATEGORY;
    @Register(name = "your_custom_name")
    public static SoundCategory CUSTOM_NAME;
    @Register(defaultLevel = 0f)
    public static SoundCategory OFF_BY_DEFAULT;
    @Register(toggle = true)
    public static SoundCategory TOGGLEABLE;
    @Register(tooltip = "tooltip.soundCategories.customCategories.showTooltipOnMouseHover")
    public static SoundCategory SHOW_TOOLTIP_ON_MOUSE_HOVER;
}
```

The register annotation has a few attributes:

* `master` will group all categories defined underneath it under one, accessible with a button next to the master
  category's slider.
* `name` allows you to set a custom name the category will be created under.
* `defaultLevel`, quite obviously, is used as the default level the game creates your category with.
* `toggle` allows you to replace Slider widget with Button widget - useful if you want
  to limit simply on (100%) or off (0%).
* `tooltip` displays the specified text on mouse hover, the String is interpreted as a translation key and
  holds the result of the translation by `net.minecraft.text.Text#translatable()` method or equivalent functionality.
  Make sure your language JSON files contain its key:value pair as follows:

`assets/modid/lang/en_us.json`
```json
{
  "tooltip.soundCategories.customCategories.showTooltipOnMouseHover": "It's tooltip test!"
}
```

After implementing the loader, make sure you add the class as an entrypoint for `sound-categories` in
your `fabric.mod.json`.

```json
{
  "entrypoints": {
    "sound-categories": [ "com.package.your.mod.CustomCategories" ]
  }
}
```

## Localization

The newly added category needs language definitions to show any name, apart from its key. You can do so in your `lang`
folder. For an example, you can check the
[ExtraSounds](https://github.com/stashymane/extra-sounds/) language files.
